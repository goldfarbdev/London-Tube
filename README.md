London Tube

Given a list of London Tube stations and lines, write an application to answer the following question: 

What stations are N stops from East Ham?  For stations with multiple routes include the station only

if the minimum number of stops = N.  Print out the results in alphabetical order.

For example, if N = 5, the complete answer would be:

 Bow Road

 Dagenham East

 East India

 Hackney Wick

 Leyton

 Leyton Midland Road

 Mile End

 North Greenwich

 Pudding Mill Lane

 Royal Victoria

 Stratford High Street

 Stratford International

 West Silvertown

For example, Canning Town from East Ham is possible with 4 or 5 stops, but we only consider it a

valid answer for 4 stops, not 5, since we only consider the minimum number of stops.

You may use any language and tools to write your application but please use GitHub.com to store

your code.
